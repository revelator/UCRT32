# UCRT32
repository adding the UCRT32 target to Msys2

This will include compilers for the various targets C/C++ Go and Rust.
I will also add a modified Msys2 filesystem with the UCRT32 target as otherwise you cannot build with it using Msys2.

This is just a temporary repository, package builds will have to be done by users as i cannot maintain a full repository.
If any maintainer steps up they are more than welcome to take over keeping it updated and adding package builds, just pm me.
